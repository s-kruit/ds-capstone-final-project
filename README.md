# ds-capstone-final-project

This is my final project for the EdX course 'Data Science: Capstone' from HarvardX (PH125.9x).

The project uses machine learning to classify images of hand signals representing letters in the alphabet using American Sign Language. Data is taken from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/datamunge/sign-language-mnist

Along with the PDF report, this repo includes the csv files analysed, png files used in the report, and the code used to generate the report - both in R Markdown and as an R script.
